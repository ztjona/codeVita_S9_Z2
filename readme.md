# Information
This repository contains solutions of the practice challenges published by the TCS Code Vita contest.
We make a backup of the challenge statements.

## Summary
The following items show the state on every challenge:

1. Problem A (Elections): **Presentation Error**
1. Problem B (Binary Equivalent): **Wrong answer on private cases**
1. Problem C (Unlocker): 
    * cpp **Wrong answer on private cases** 
    * python  **TLE**
1. Problem D (T9 Inverse): To do
1. Problem E (Palindromic Count): To do
1. Problem F (Lift): To do

### Note
**Presentation error** means that it is correct, but in a different "format" than required. Usually due to the line break.

**Wrong answer on private cases** means that it passed the public cases but not the private ones. Maybe because the statement was misunderstood.

**TLE** means that the code is not efficient or has a naive approach.

**To do** means that the challenge is pending to be tried.

## About the problems
The statement of every problem was originally posted at codevita web site.
https://practice.tcscodevita.com/

Additionally, the challenges are publicly available in several websites.

## Important tips about the contest
* Avoid using non standard characters such as é, ñ, etc in your code. Even in the comments.
* Seems that c++ code is preferred over than python, because our python code that got TLE worked fine in c++.
